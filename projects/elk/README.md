## How to use Logstash

  1. Define the custom logstash configuration files and place under /etc/logstash/conf.d/
  2. To pick the placed configuration file, restart the logstash service with command:
  ``service logstash restart``
  3. If service is not up, check the logstash log file /var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log

### Logstash example with file as input:
```
input {
    file {
        path => "/var/log/airflow.log"
        type => "logs"
        start_position => "beginning"
    }
}
output {
   elasticsearch {
     hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
     index => <index-name>
  }
}
```
